     * I built an algorithm that instead of checking the entire board on each turn, I only check if the last move was the winning move.
     * The algorithm works in a simple way, every time someone puts a disk into the board I take its position and check every possible combination with the new point.
     * I divided the Algorithms into 5 parts:
     * Horizontal,
     * Vertical,
     * Diagonal Bottom Right To Top Left,
     * Diagonal Bottom Left To Top Right,
     * Draw
     *
     * My board is represented by an ints matrix. the matrix is initialized to 0,
     * and every time a player makes a move, the relevant coordinate updates to his ID
     * If a player wins, I return his ID. If no one has won this round I return -1, and if there was a draw, I return 0.
     * 
     * Every turn I have to find the starting point of a possible combination and the ending point of the combination,
     * each time a player makes a move, I am checking where the streak can be started (the streak may start in a different coordinate)
